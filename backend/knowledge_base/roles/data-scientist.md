# Data Scientist

## Overview
Extracts insights from data using statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Bridges business strategy and technical implementation to drive data-driven decision making.

## Core Responsibilities
- Design and deploy predictive models
- Communicate insights to stakeholders
- Collaborate with engineering on production systems
- Validate data quality and assumptions
- Build dashboards and reports

## Required Skills
**Technical**: Python, SQL, Statistics, Machine Learning, Data Visualization
**Tools**: pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Tableau/PowerBI
**Soft**: Communication, Problem-solving, Business acumen

## Typical Background
Bachelor's or Master's in Computer Science, Statistics, Math, or related field. 2-5 years experience with data analysis or software engineering. Portfolio of data projects demonstrating end-to-end workflows.

## Career Progression
Junior Data Scientist → Data Scientist → Senior Data Scientist → Lead/Principal → Director of Data Science

Alternative paths: ML Engineer, Data Engineering, Analytics Engineering
